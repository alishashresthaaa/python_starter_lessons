# Python is a type less language, as it doesn't need variable
# to define the type explicitly

# Python interprets the code into machine level which means it doesn't
# generate .exe (executable file). it directly converts and executes the
# code line by line

# Variables, values, print
x = 0
y = 2
sum = x + y
# print(sum)
